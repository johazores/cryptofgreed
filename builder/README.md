# Crypt of Greed NFT Smart Contract System

A smart contract system for minting game-based NFTs on Core DAO, built for the Core DAO Hackathon. This project is part of the Crypt of Greed roguelike card game, enabling players to mint their in-game achievements, characters, and rare items as NFTs.

## Deployment Information

Deploying contract with the account: 0x3632971f783809Eb79FE94E08C97A8d0b0B32824
Contract address: 0xE80C3d90586D1E39B2484dBb01AcD96BC4Bfc1f1

## Features

### Core Smart Contract Functions

#### Game Asset NFT Minting

- `mintCharacterNFT(string memory tokenURI)`: Mints a new NFT representing a player character
- `mintEquipmentNFT(string memory tokenURI)`: Mints equipment NFTs
- `mintAchievementNFT(string memory tokenURI)`: Mints achievement-based NFTs
- `getAssetsByOwner(address owner)`: Retrieves all game assets owned by a specific address
- `tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)`: Gets the metadata URI for a specific token

#### Access Control

- `pause()`: Pauses contract operations in emergency situations
- `unpause()`: Resumes contract operations
- `setMintPrice(uint256 newPrice)`: Updates the minting price (admin only)

#### Metadata Management

- `setBaseURI(string memory newBaseURI)`: Updates the base URI for token metadata
- `updateTokenURI(uint256 tokenId, string memory newURI)`: Updates metadata for existing token

## Technical Details

### Built With

- Hardhat
- OpenZeppelin Contracts

```

4. Verify contract:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network core [CONTRACT_ADDRESS]
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```
